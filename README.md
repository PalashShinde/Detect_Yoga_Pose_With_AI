# Detect Similarity in Yoga Pose using Alphapose Model

[Alphapose Pose Estimaion Model](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose) AlphaPose is an accurate multi-person pose estimator, which is the first open-source system that achieves 70+ mAP (75 mAP) on COCO dataset and 80+ mAP (82.1 mAP) on MPII dataset. To match poses that correspond to the same person across frames, we also provide an efficient online pose tracker called Pose Flow. It is the first open-source online pose tracker that achieves both 60+ mAP (66.5 mAP) and 50+ MOTA (58.3 MOTA) on PoseTrack Challenge dataset.

### Yoga Pose Simlirity Detection

This Flask application mainly helps in Detetcting Similarity between user input Yoga Pose and Ideal one and Returns a Similarity score for those two Poses.
